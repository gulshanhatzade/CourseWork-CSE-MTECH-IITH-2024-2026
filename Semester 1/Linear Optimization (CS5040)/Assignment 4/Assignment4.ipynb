        "## Converting Initial Feasible Solution to a Vertex and Tracking Costs\n",
        "This code is defining no. of variables \\( n \\) based on number of columns in that constraint matrix \\(A\\). It calls `feasible_to_vertex` function to convet initial feasible solution into the vertex of feasible region. function returns updated solution (`init_feasible_sol`), sequence of costs at each vertex (`costs`), and list of vertices visited during process (`vertices`). This step is essential for moving from an initial feasible solution to an optimal vertex while tracking objective function values throughout iterations.\n"
