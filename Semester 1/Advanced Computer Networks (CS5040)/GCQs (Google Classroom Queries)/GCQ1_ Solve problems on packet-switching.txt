Q1)
a)Store and forward switching
Total delay in transmitting P packets from source to destination over N links
= P*tf + N*tp + (n-1)* tf
= P*L/R + N*D/S + (n-1)* L/R
=(P +N-1)*L/R +  N*D/S


b) Pass through switching
Total delay in transmitting P packets from source to destination over N links
= P*tf + N*tp
=P*L/R + N*D/S


P6)
a. Propagation delay, dprop=m/s sec
b. Transmission time of the packet, dtrans= L/R s
c.  The end-to-end delay= (L/R + m/s) s
d. The last bit of the packet will start propogating.
e. If dprop is greater than dtrans. At time t = dtrans
Then, the first bit of the packet is present on the link.
f. If dprop is less than dtrans. At time t = dtrans,
Then the first bit of the packet is at destination.
g. dprop = dtrans
  m/s=L/R
     m/(2.5* 10^8)= (1500*8 bit)/(10*10^6)
      m=300000 meter
     m=300km






P7)
Time require to generate all the bits
56.8/(64*10^3)= 7ms


For transmitting packet, time required is
56.8/(10*10^6)= 0.0488 ms


tp=10ms
delay= 7ms + 0.0488 ms +10ms= 17.0488 ms
