GCQ4: Understanding network delays using traceroute utility in Linux
30 points
Due Aug 12, 2024
Run traceroute command on three different destination hosts (e.g., a local server like IITH website or CSE@IITH website, a web server in another country like MIT website, and a popular website like google.com or Facebook.com) from your laptop by connecting it to two access networks: a) IITH LAN or Wi-Fi network and b) 4G or 5G network by creating a hotspot on your mobile phone, and record the outputs. Analyse the outputs to identify the number of hops (routers) between your source and the destination for each traceroute and observe how delays (Round-Trip-Times (RTTs)) vary from hop to hop. Identify any significant increases in delay between consecutive hops. Hypothesize why these increases might occur, considering factors like queuing, congestion, or routing changes. Compare the traceroute results for the three different destinations over two access networks in terms of a) How does the number of hops change with the geographic distance to the destination?, b) How do the RTT values change with distance and network path?, and c) Are there any patterns in delay fluctuations? What might be causing these? List out if there are any key findings or strange patterns.

Identifying number of hops between source and destination:
     1) IITH website
                               College Wi-Fi: 6 hops
                               Mobile 4G: 15 hops
     2) MIT Website
                                 College Wi-Fi: 13 hops
                                 Mobile 4G: 12 hops
     3)Google
                                 College Wi-Fi: 14 hops
                                 Mobile 4G: 17 hops  
By observing this we can conclude that the number of hops generally increases with geographic distance. Accessing with IITH Wi-Fi, the IITH website has fewer hops compared to MIT and Google. Accessing with mobile 4G network, the number of hops increases most probably due to increased intermediate networks and the nature of mobile networks with potentially more complex routing paths.


Observing the delays(Round Trip Times):
1) IITH Website
College Wi-Fi: RTTs range from 0.365 ms to 13.905 ms.
Mobile 4G: RTTs range from 0.465 ms to 93.182 ms.
2) MIT Website
College Wi-Fi: RTTs range from 0.413 ms to 40.841 ms.
Mobile 4G: RTTs range from 0.447 ms to 75.627 ms.
3) Google
College Wi-Fi: RTTs range from 0.320 ms to 33.961 ms.
Mobile 4G: RTTs range from 0.606 ms to 92.763 ms.


By observing the round trip times(RTTs) we can see RTT value generally increase with distance from the source to destination. Compared to the 4G network Wi-Fi shows lower RTTs, most probably due to lower latency and more direct routing paths in a wired or stable Wi-Fi network compared to mobile network which might involve IP overheads.


Identifying Significant Delays Between Hops:
IITH Website - College Wi-Fi
Significant increase from hop 1 to hop 6, likely due to queuing or crossing into different network segments . Due to congestion queuing might happen and the network exchange points may experience higher traffic which can cause delay.


a) The number of hops generally increase with geographic distance to the destination. This we can conclude by IITH(local) to MIT(international destination).
b) RTT values increase with distance. Mobile 4G networks show higher RTTs compared to IITH Wi-Fi.
c) Patterns in Delay Fluctuations likely due to queuing , routing , crossing international borders( international delay can be seen in MIT and Google). 


Key Findings and Strange Patterns
The number of hops and RTT values  increase with geographic distance.
College Wi-Fi is more stable, with fewer hops and lower RTTs, while mobile 4G networks have variability.
